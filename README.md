## Arduino Robotic Arm
The goal is to create a robotic arm that can direct a light towards an area that I am working on.

## Components
 - Arduino Uno R3
 - HC-SR04 utrasonic sonar
 - 2x SG90 servo motor
 - Breadboard
 - Jumper wires
 - 5V Power supply
 - Building materials

## Reflection
Pretty happy with the end result, given the limited amount of electronics I have. As it stands, the ultrasonic sonar is not consistent at detecting uneven surfaces. 
Looking to add an infared sensor; or perhaps use a raspberry pi, with a webcam and deep learning instead.
